<!-- This is a template for new feature proposals.

It's fine if you don't have all the details: you can start with the Summary and Rationale.
-->

# Proposal: [your title here] 
<!-- Add a title for your feature proposal. Please be short and descriptive -->

## Summary
<!-- Include 1-2 sentences summarizing your feature proposal -->

## Rationale
<!-- Create a list that describes WHY the feature should be added to Jump Point.
Proposals often have multiple motives for why we should do the work, so list each one as a separate bullet.
-->
* {First reason for why we should consider this proposal}
* {Second reason for why we should consider this proposal}
* {etc}

## Scope
<!-- Please include a list of what the feature should and shouldn't do by filling in the table below.
'Must' implies that the feature should not ship without this capability.  
'Should' is something we should push hard for, but is not absolutely required to ship.
'Could' is a nice-to-have; a good stretch goal that isn't painful if we don't achieve it.
'Won't' is a clear statement that the proposal/feature will intentionally not have that capability.
This list will evolve and grow as the proposal becomes more refined over time.
-->
| Capability | Priority |
| :---------- | :------- |
| This proposal will allow developers to accomplish W | Must |
| This proposal will allow end users to accomplish X | Should |
| This proposal will allow developers to accomplish Y | Could |
| This proposal will allow end users to accomplish Z | Won't |

## Important Notes
<!-- Please include any other important details.
This could include one or more of:
- usage examples
- an API proposal (any supported language or pseudocode is fine)
- design mockups or example screenshots
- other implementation notes
-->

## Open Questions
<!-- Please list any open issues that you think still need to be addressed. -->
